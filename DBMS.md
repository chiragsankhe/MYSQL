##  What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?
+ A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that is used to manage and organize databases.
+  It provides an interface to interact with the data stored in a database.
+  The DBMS is responsible for tasks such as storing, retrieving, and updating data, ensuring data integrity, security, and managing concurrency.
+  Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

##  What are the advantages of using a DBMS?
+ `Data Integrity`: Ensures that the data is accurate and consistent.
+ `Data Security`: Provides controlled access to sensitive data by setting permissions for different users.
+ `Efficient Data Retrieval`: Optimizes queries and indexing, allowing faster data retrieval.
+ `Reduced Redundancy`: Avoids duplicate data by enforcing normalization.
+ `Backup and Recovery`: Offers automatic backup and recovery mechanisms.
+ `Concurrent Access`: Allows multiple users to access the database at the same time without conflicts

## What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
+ `DBMS` (Database Management System): A system that allows users to create, store, modify, and delete data. 
+ It does not require a relational structure for data organization. Examples: Microsoft Access, XML databases.
+ `RDBMS` (Relational Database Management System): A subset of DBMS that stores data in a structured format, using tables (relations), and supports relational operations + like joins. It enforces data integrity through keys and supports SQL for querying. Examples: MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server.


## What are the different types of DBMS?
+ The four types of DBMS are:

+ `Hierarchical DBMS`: Data is organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships. Example: IBM’s IMS.
+ `Network DBMS`: Data is represented as a `graph` with many-to-many relationships. Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).
+ `Relational DBMS (RDBMS`): Data is organized in tables (relations) and managed through SQL. Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
+ `Object-Oriented DBMS`: Data is stored as objects, like in object-oriented programming. Example: ObjectDB.


## What is a relation in DBMS?
+ A relation in DBMS is a table that consists of rows and columns.
+  Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute or property of the entity being described.
+   Relations are defined by a schema, which specifies the attributes (columns) of the table

  ##  at is a table in DBMS?
+ A table in DBMS is a collection of data organized in rows and columns.
+  It is the primary structure for storing data in a relational database.
+  Each row represents an entity (record), and each column represents an attribute of that entity.


## What are rows and columns in a DBMS?
+ `Rows` (Tuples): A row represents a single record or entity. Each row contains values for each attribute (column).
Columns (Attributes): A column represents a property or characteristic of the entity. Each column has a data type, such as integer, string, etc

## What is a primary key? Explain with an example.
+ A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no two records have the same value for the primary key field.
+ It cannot contain NULL values. Example: In a `STUDENT table`,` ROLL_NO` could be the primary key because each student has a unique roll number.


|ROLL_NO|	NAME	|ADDRESS|
|-------|-------|--------|
|1|	Ram	|Delhi|
|2|	Suresh|	Delhi |
`
## What is a foreign key? Explain with an example.
+ A Foreign Key is an attribute in a table that links to the primary key in another table. 
+ It creates a relationship between two tables, ensuring referential integrity.
+ Example: In a STUDENT table, the BRANCH_CODE could be a foreign key referencing the primary key BRANCH_CODE in the BRANCH table.

Student Table

|ROLL_NO	|NAME |	BRANCH_CODE|
|--------|------|-----------|
|1|	Ram	|CS|
|2|	Suresh	|IT|

|BRANCH Table| BRANCH_CODE|	BRANCH_NAME|
|------------|-------------|---------|
|CS	|Computer| Science|
|IT	|Information| Technology|

Here, BRANCH_CODE in STUDENT is a foreign key referencing BRANCH_CODE in BRANCH.


## The Entity-Relationship (ER) Model is a high-level conceptual data model used to define the structure of a database in terms of:

+ Entities

+ Attributes


🔷 Key Components of ER Model:
## 1. Entity
An entity is an object or thing in the real world that is distinguishable from other objects.

📌 Example: Student, Employee, Book

Types of Entities:

+ Strong Entity – Exists independently (e.g., Student)

+ Weak Entity – Depends on another entity (e.g., Dependent of Employee)

## 2. Attribute
+ Attributes are properties or details of an entity.

📌 Example: A Student entity may have attributes like RollNo, Name, Age.

## Types of Attributes:

|Type	|Description|	Example|
|---------|-----------|-----------|
|Simple	|Cannot be divided further|	Age, Salary|
|Composite	|Can be divided into smaller parts	|Name → First, Last|
|Derived	|Can be derived from other attributes|	Age from DOB|
|Multivalued|	Can have multiple values	|PhoneNumbers|
Key Attribute|	Uniquely identifies an entity|	StudentID|

## 3. Relationship
A relationship represents how two or more entities are related to each other.

📌 Example: A Student enrolls in a Course.

## Types of Relationships:

Type	Description	Example
+ `One-to-One` 	 One entity maps to one only	Employee ↔ ParkingSpot
+ `One-to-Many`	 One maps to many	Teacher → Students
+ `Many-to-One`	 Many maps to one	Orders → Customer
+ `Many-to-Many` 	Many map to many	Student ↔ Course

## What are constraints in DBMS?
+ Constraints in DBMS are rules that limit the type of data that can be inserted into a table to ensure data integrity and consistency.
+  Common types of constraints include: `NOT NULL`,` PRIMARY KEY`,` FOREIGN KEY`,` UNIQUE`,` CHECK`,` DEFAULT`.

## what is diffrenc between unique and null constrains?
###  ` UNIQUE Constraint`:
+ Ensures all values in a column (or combination of columns) are distinct.

+ Allows only one occurrence of each value.

+ ✅ Allows NULL values (but the behavior depends on the database):

+ Most databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) allow multiple NULLs in a UNIQUE column.

+ NULL is not considered "equal" to another NULL.

Example:
```
CREATE TABLE users (
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```
+ ✅ Allows: ('a@example.com'), ('b@example.com'), (NULL), (NULL)
+ ❌ Error if you try to insert another 'a@example.com'.

### 🔹 NOT NULL Constraint:
+ Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.

+ It does not restrict uniqueness, only that the value must exist.

Example:
```
CREATE TABLE users (
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```
+ ❌ Cannot insert: (NULL)
+ ✅ Can insert duplicate values like ('chirag'), ('chirag')

## what is degree of relation

### 🔹 Degree of a Relation:
+ The number of attributes (columns) in a relation (table).

🔹 Example:
```
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Course VARCHAR(50)
);
```
Here:

+ Attributes (columns): StudentID, Name, Age, Course

+ ✅ Degree = 4

##  Cardinality

### 🔹 Related Term – Cardinality:
+ While degree is the number of columns,
+ cardinality is the number of rows (tuples) in the table.

Example:
```
StudentID	Name	Age	Course
101	Chirag	20	Java
102	Ravi	21	Python
103	Riya	22	Web Dev
```
✅ Degree = 4 (4 columns)

✅ Cardinality = 3 (3 rows)

## DBMS architecture 
## diffrent type of schema 
## explain diffrent schemas like view level , logical , physical 

+ In DBMS architecture, the database is divided into three levels to separate concerns and manage complexity:

### 🔺 1. View Level (External Level)
+ 📌 What it is: The highest level of abstraction.

+ 👀 What users see: It defines what part of the data is visible to individual users or applications.

+ 🔐 Provides security by restricting access to only necessary data.

+ ✅ A user can have multiple views.

Example:

+ A student using an app may only see their name, courses, and grades — not internal IDs or admin data.

```
CREATE VIEW student_view AS
SELECT name, course, grade FROM student;
```
### 🔧 2. Logical Level (Conceptual Level)
+ 📌 What it is: The middle level of abstraction.

+ 🎯 Describes what data is stored in the database and relationships among the data.

+ 💾 Defines tables, attributes, data types, constraints.

+ 🚫 Hides storage and access methods.

Example:

Defines tables like Student, Course, Enrollment and their relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, etc.

### 💽 3. Physical Level (Internal Level)
+ 📌 What it is: The lowest level, closest to the hardware.

+ 🧠 Describes how data is physically stored: files, indexes, block allocation, compression, etc.

+ 🔒 Not visible to end users or developers.

Example:

How rows are stored in blocks, what indexing strategy is used, how tables are organized on disk.

## 4 main types of database languages in DBMS, each serving a different purpose:

### 🔹 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
+ 📌 Used to define and modify database structure (tables, schemas).

+ ⚙️ It deals with creating, altering, and deleting database objects.

Common DDL Commands:



+ `CREATE`     -- Create a new table or database
+ `ALTER `     -- Modify existing table structure
+ `DROP`       -- Delete table or database
+` TRUNCATE`   -- Remove all records from a table (faster than DELETE)

### 🔹 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
+ 📌 Used to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.

+ 🧑‍💻 It interacts with the data inside the tables.

Common DML Commands:


+ `SELECT `    -- Retrieve data
+ `INSERT`     -- Add new data
+ `UPDATE `    -- Modify existing data
+ `DELETE`     -- Remove data
  
### 🔹 3. Data Control Language (DCL)
📌 Used to control access to data in the database.

+ 🔐 It handles permissions and security.

Common DCL Commands:


+ GRANT      -- Give access to users
+ REVOKE     -- Remove access from users
  
### 🔹 4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
+ 📌 Used to manage transactions in a database.

+ 🔄 Ensures data consistency and rollback in case of errors.

Common TCL Commands:


+ COMMIT     -- Save changes
+ ROLLBACK   -- Undo changes
+ SAVEPOINT  -- Set a point to rollback to
+ SET TRANSACTION -- Set properties for a transaction
+ 


##  What is Indexing in DBMS?
+ Indexing is a data structure technique used in DBMS to quickly retrieve records from a database without scanning the entire table.

+ It works just like an index in a book — it helps you find data faster, rather than checking every page (row).

### ✅ Why Use Indexing?
+ To speed up SELECT queries.

 =To reduce disk I/O operations.

+ Especially useful on large tables with millions of records.

#### 🏗️ How It Works (Basic Idea):
+ The DBMS creates a separate data structure (like a B-tree or Hash table).

+ This structure stores key values and a pointer to the actual row in the table.

📂 Example:
Suppose you have this table:
```
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);
```
Now you create an index:

```
CREATE INDEX dept_index ON Employee(Department);
```
Now when you run:
```
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE Department = 'HR';
```
+ 💨 It uses the dept_index instead of scanning the full table.

🧠 Types of Indexes:
|Type|	Description|
|----|-------------|
|Primary Index|	Automatically created on primary key|
|Unique Index|	Ensures all values are unique|
|Clustered Index|	Alters the physical order of rows|
|Non-Clustered Index|	Separate from actual table data|
|Composite Index|	Index on multiple columns|
|Bitmap Index	|Uses bitmaps, efficient in low-cardinality data (used in Data Warehouse)|

### ❗ Disadvantages:
+ Slows down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE (because index must be updated).

+ Takes extra disk space.

+ Over-indexing can harm performance.

📌 Summary:
### Feature	Description
+ Purpose	Speed up data retrieval
+ Works on	One or more columns
+ Benefits	Fast SELECT queries
+ Cost	Extra memory and slower write operations

## 🔍 Difference Between WHERE and HAVING Clause
|Feature|	WHERE Clause	|HAVING Clause|
|📌 Purpose|	Filters rows before grouping	|Filters groups after GROUP BY|
|🧱 Works On|	Individual rows|	Aggregated groups|
|🧮 Used |With	SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE|	Usually with GROUP BY|
|🔢 Aggregate Functions|	❌ Cannot be used with aggregates directly|	✅ Used to filter with aggregate functions|
|📍 Executes|	Before GROUP BY|	After GROUP BY\


### ✅ WHERE Clause Example:
```
SELECT * FROM Employee
WHERE Department = 'HR';
```
Filters individual rows where Department = 'HR'.


### ✅ HAVING Clause Example:
```
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```
First groups employees by department.

Then filters only those groups with more than 5 employees.

### 🔄 Both Used Together Example:
```
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary)
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary > 30000
GROUP BY Department
HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000;
```
+ WHERE filters out low-salary employees before grouping.

+ HAVING filters out departments with low average salaries after grouping.


## 🔍 Difference Between File System and DBMS

|Feature	|File System|	DBMS (Database Management System)|
|--------|---------------|---------------------------------|
|📁 Definition| Manages files on disk manually|	Software to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently|
|📦 Data Storage|	Stores data in flat files (e.g., .txt, .csv)|	Stores data in tables with schemas|
|🔍 Querying Data|	No built-in query language|	Uses SQL for powerful querying|
|🧱 Structure|	No strict structure;| programmer-defined	Strict structure using tables, rows, and columns|

|🔁 Concurrency| Control	No built-in support for multiple users	|Built-in support for multiple users accessing data|
|🧪 Data Integrity|	Handled manually by programmer	|Enforced automatically by constraints (e.g., PK, FK)|
|🔁 Backup & Recovery|	Manual and difficult|	Automatic, supports backup & recovery features||
|🔄 Transactions (ACID)	|Not supported	|Fully supports ACID properties|
|📊 Performance	|Slower for large datasets|	Optimized for performance and large-scale data|



## 📘 Generalization and Specialization in DBMS (ER Model)
+ These are conceptual modeling techniques used in Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to handle hierarchical relationships between entities.

### 🔼 Generalization:
🧠 Definition:
+ Combining two or more lower-level entities into a higher-level (more general) entity.

+ It is a bottom-up approach.

+ 🔍 Purpose:
+ To abstract common features from multiple entities.

✅ Example:
Entities:
```
Car (has model, engineNo)

Bike (has model, engineNo)
```
⬇️ Generalization:

+ Vehicle (superclass with common attributes like model, engineNo)

```
   Car       Bike
     \       /
     Vehicle   ← generalized entity
```
### 🔽 Specialization:
 🧠 Definition:
+ Creating subclasses (more specific entities) from a higher-level entity.

+ It is a top-down approach.

🔍 Purpose:
+ To add specific attributes or behaviors to different subtypes.

✅ Example:
+ Entity:

  =Employee (has name, id)

⬇️ Specialization:

+ Manager (adds bonus)

Developer (adds programmingLanguage)

```
   Employee
    /    \
Manager  Developer
```
#### 🧬 Difference Between Generalization and Specialization:
|Feature	|Generalization|	Specialization|
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
|🔼 Approach|	Bottom-up	|Top-down|
|🔧 Operation|	Combines multiple entities	|Breaks a single entity into sub-entities|
|📌 Focus|	Common features abstraction	|Specific features extension|
|💡 Exampl|e	Car + Bike → Vehicle|	Employee → Manager, Developer|


## 📘 What is Normalization in DBMS?
+ Normalization is a process in relational database design that organizes data efficiently by:

+ Removing data redundancy (duplicate data),

+ Ensuring data integrity,

 +Making data easier to maintain.

## 🔧 Why Normalization is Important?
Problem Without Normalization	What Happens
+ 🔁 Data redundancy	Same data repeated in multiple places
+ ❌ Insertion anomaly	Can’t insert data without other unrelated data
+ 📝 Update anomaly	Need to update the same data in many rows
+ ❌ Deletion anomaly	Deleting a row may remove critical information

📶 Normal Forms (NF)
There are multiple levels (called normal forms) used to normalize a table. Each level has rules.

## 🔹 1. First Normal Form (1NF)
✅ Rule:

 + Each cell should contain atomic (indivisible) values.

+ No repeating groups or arrays in a column.

🔁 Example Violation:

```
Name       | Phone
-----------|------------------
Chirag     | 12345, 67890     ❌
```
✅ Fixed:
```
Edit
Name       | Phone
-----------|--------
Chirag     | 12345
Chirag     | 67890
``
### 🔹 2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
✅ Rule:

+ Must be in 1NF, and

+ No partial dependency (non-key attribute should depend on the full primary key).

❌ Violation:

```
(StudentID, CourseID) → CourseName  ← only depends on CourseID
```
✅ Fix: Move CourseID → CourseName to a separate table.

### 🔹 3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
✅ Rule:

+ Must be in 2NF, and

+ No transitive dependency (non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes).

❌ Violation:
```
StudentID → DepartmentID → DepartmentName
```
✅ Fix: Split into two tables.


## 🔒 What is Integrity Constraint in DBMS?
+ An Integrity Constraint is a rule that ensures the `accuracy`, `validity`, and` consistency `of data in a database.

+ These rules are defined on tables and columns to prevent invalid data from being inserted, updated, or deleted.

### ✅ Common Types of Integrity Constraints:
Constraint Type	Description
+ 1. `NOT NULL`	Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
+ 2. `UNIQUE`	Ensures all values in a column are different.
+ 3. `PRIMARY KEY`	Combines NOT NULL + UNIQUE. Identifies each row uniquely.
+ 4. `FOREIGN KEY`	Ensures a column’s value matches a value in another table. Maintains referential integrity.
+ 5. `CHECK`	Validates data against a custom rule or condition.
+ 6.` DEFAULT` 	Assigns a default value if no value is provided.

🧱 Example Table:
```
CREATE TABLE Student (
    RollNo INT PRIMARY KEY,             -- Uniquely identifies each student
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,          -- Cannot be NULL
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18),          -- Must be 18 or older
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,          -- No duplicate emails allowed
    DeptID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Department(DeptID)  -- Must exist in Department table
);
```
### 🔄 Why Integrity Constraints Are Important?
+ Benefit	Description
+ ✅ `Data accuracy	` Prevents invalid data from entering the table
+ 🔒 `Data consistency`	Keeps relationships between tables consistent
+ 🔁 `Automatic enforcement` 	Enforced automatically by DBMS
+ 📉 ` Reduces` bugs	Less chance of data corruption or logic errors

##  Pattern Matching in SQL
+ Pattern Matching in SQL is used to search for specific patterns in text data (like names, emails, addresses, etc.) using the LIKE, ILIKE, or REGEXP operators depending on the DBMS.

✅ Most Common: LIKE Operator
🔹 Syntax:
```
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';
```
+ 🔤 Wildcards used with `LIKE`:
|Wildcard|	Meaning|	Example	Matches|
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
|  % |	Matches any number of characters	name LIKE 'A%'\	Alice, Amit, Alex
|  _ |	Matches a single character|	name LIKE |'_at'	Cat, Bat, Hat
| [ ] |	Character range (in some DBMS)	name LIKE '[CH]at' (SQL Server)|	Chat, Hat

🔍 Examples:
### 1. Starts with 'A'
```
SELECT * FROM Employee
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```
### 2. Ends with 'n'
```
SELECT * FROM Student
WHERE name LIKE '%n';
```
### 3. Contains 'ra'
```
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE name LIKE '%ra%';
```
### 4. Exactly 4-letter names starting with ‘J’
```
SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE name LIKE 'J___';
```
